# No More Long Handed Inserters

Removes long handed inserters from technologies and crafting.  
This currently includes the base game's Long-handed inserter, and [Renai Transportation](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RenaiTransportation)'s Thrower Long-handed inserter.

Meant for use with [Bob's Adjustable Inserters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobinserters).
